                <h3 class="text-secondary">Background</h3>
                <!-- <h6>position</h6> -->
                <p>From my past work experiences in the hospitality sector I gained skills that I can apply in web development. Whether it's the start of a new project or joining an existing one, I learned to adapt to each work environment and adjust quickly to the new conditions. With patience and perseverance, combined with strategic thinking and attention to detail, I obtained the right results and delivered excelent products and services, bringing my contribution to the success of my team and contentment of our customers. </p>

            <div class="job job2">
                <h3 class="text-secondary">Motivation</h3>
                <!-- <h6>position</h6> -->
                <p>My interest in coding has increased in the last few years, and now I want to turn my passion into a carrier. I started my learning path with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I added Scss, Bootstrap and Materialize on the design part, and Webpack and version control on the functional side. Now I dive into the modern web development, having already had a taste of Vue.js and React.js, and I find it fascinating how these libraries increase efficiency, speed-up performance and improve code maintainability.</p>

            <div class="job job3">
                <h3 class="text-secondary">Leisure</h3>
                <!-- <h6>position</h6> -->
                <p>I try to work on my projects every day, adding a new feature or just looking for inspiration. The rest of the time you'll find me cooking, watching documentaries or tv series, motor races or tennis competitions. Outdoor activities or visiting historical places help me clear my mind and recharge my batteries. Some say that time spent in the shadow of past time is the most valuable in the world. Walking on the footsteps of ancient warriors or emperors is overwhelming and empowering.</p>
