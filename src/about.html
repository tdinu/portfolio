                <h3 class="text-secondary">Background</h3>
                <!-- <h6>position</h6> -->
                <p>From my past work experiences in different sectors I gained skills that I can apply in web development. Whether it's the start of a new project or joining an existing one, I learned to adapt to each work environment and adjust quickly to the new conditions and requirements. With patience and perseverance, combined with strategic thinking and attention to detail, I obtained the right results and delivered excelent products and services, bringing my contribution to the success of my team and satisfaction of our customers. </p>

            <div class="job job2">
                <h3 class="text-secondary">Motivation</h3>
                <!-- <h6>position</h6> -->
                <p>My passion for coding has increased over the years, and with ambition and determination I managed to catch up with the latest news in web development. I re-started my learning path with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, adding Sass and Bootstrap on the styling part, and Webpack and version control (git) on the functional side. I topped with modern tools and technologies, using in React.js in the last few years, and I find it fascinating how libraries like this increase efficiency, speed-up performance and improve code maintainability.</p>

            <div class="job job3">
                <h3 class="text-secondary">Leisure</h3>
                <!-- <h6>position</h6> -->
                <p>I like learning new skills and recently I have been interested in photography. I like spending time in nature and capture rare moments with the camera. The rest of the time you'll find me cooking, watching documentaries or tv series, motor races or tennis competitions. Outdoor activities or visiting historical places help me clear my mind and recharge my batteries. Some say that time spent in the shadow of past is the most valuable in the world. Walking on the footsteps of ancient warriors or emperors is overwhelming and empowering.</p>
