                <!-- <h6>position</h6> -->
                <p>Through my diverse work experiences in various sectors, I have developed skills that are highly applicable to web development. Whether initiating a new project or integrating into an existing one, I have learned to adapt to different work environments and swiftly adjust to new conditions and requirements. My patience and perseverance, coupled with strategic thinking and attention to detail, have enabled me to achieve optimal results and deliver excellent products and services. This has contributed significantly to my team's success and ensured customer satisfaction.</p>

                <h3 class="text-secondary">Motivation</h3>
                <!-- <h6>position</h6> -->
                <p>My passion for coding has grown over the years. With ambition and determination, I have kept up with the most recent advancements in web development. I restarted my learning path with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhancing my styling skills with Sass and Bootstrap, and improving functionality with Webpack and version control (Git). In recent years, I have also incorporated modern tools and technologies, particularly JavaScript frameworks. Moving forward, I strive to continue developing my skills and add mobile app development to my expertise.</p>

                <h3 class="text-secondary">Leisure</h3>
                <!-- <h6>position</h6> -->
                <p>I love learning new skills and lately, I've gotten into photography. There's nothing like spending time in nature and snapping photos of those rare, beautiful moments. When I'm not behind the camera, you'll find me in the kitchen cooking, binge-watching documentaries or TV series, or catching up on motor races and tennis matches. I also enjoy outdoor activities and visiting historical sitesâ€”they're great for clearing my mind and recharging. I believe that time spent exploring the past is incredibly valuable. Walking in the footsteps of ancient warriors or emperors is truly inspiring.</p>
